# open-source-chess-v2

This is a second attempt at a good working chess implementation that  
hopefully fills these requirements and gets finished:

- Can be used for free comercially.
- Is moderately portable.
- Is well made.
- Supports deep customization.
- Built with react and typescript for a better build environment.
